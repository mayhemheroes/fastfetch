# 1.6.1

Fixes build on android (#205)

# 1.6.0

Features:
* Detect QT on more DEs than just KDE Plasma. The [Plasma] category was therefore renamed to [QT]
* Alacritty font detection
* Load `/etc/fastfetch/config.conf` before user config
* Disk: print one decimal point if size < 100GB
* `--title-fqdn` option, to print fully qualified domain name instead of host name in title
 
Logos:
* updated old NixOS logo

Bugfixes:
* Correctly detect GTK on DEs that store their settings in dconf
* Correctly detect NixOS packages
* Mutter WM detected once again
* Show full NixOS version in OS output
* Don't segfault if an invalid structure is given
* WSL doesn't output GPU anymore, as the name is always meaningless
